## Research

My primary research interests lie in Computational and Applied Mathematics with an emphasis on numerical methods and theoretical analyses of dynamical systems for dilute gas mixtures. My secondary research interests are in Mathematical Biology, with an emphasis on vector borne epidemiological models.

### Current Projects

I am currently funded through a DOE grant to develop theory and numerical methods for Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) kinetic models, with my collaborators Dr. Cory Hauck (ORNL) and Dr. Steven Wise (UTK). In particular, I have developed implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods for the standard BGK model, and I have been studying a multi-species BGK model, with temperature dependent collision frequencies.

For the moment system of equations, I have proved existence and uniqueness of solutions, and established bounds on the asymptotic relaxation of the solution to constant steady state values. (Article submitted to SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics; see the arXiv.org preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12885).) 

On the numerical side, I have developed an IMEX method that computes the implicit update using a nonlinear iterative solver to compute the implicit step for the collision operator. (Journal article to be submitted to SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing in the next week or two.)
