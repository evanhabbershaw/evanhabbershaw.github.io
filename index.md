Hello, this the website of Evan Habbershaw. It is currently under development. Come back after the weekend, and it will be updated with some of my information.


If you want to use this space to write your biography here, edit the `index.md` file. You can put a picture in, too. Rename your picture to `profile.png` and put it in the `assets/images/` folder.

The social-icons footer can be used to link profiles from GitHub, OrcID and ReasearchGate aprart form the usual Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can add your user ID in the `_config.yml` file to link your accounts.
