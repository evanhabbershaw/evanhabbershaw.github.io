## About

### Short Biography

I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), and work as a Graduate Research Associate, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Before coming to Tennessee, I earned my BS in Pure Mathematics, and MS in Applied Mathematics, from California State University, Northridge. [Here is my CV](https://github.com/evanhabbershaw/evanhabbershaw.github.io/blob/master/files/CV/vitae.pdf).

### Research

My research interests lie in Computational and Applied Mathematics. Over the past few years, I have developed theory and numerical methods to generate approximate solutions of mathematical models that describe the dynamics of dilute, non-reactive, multi-species particle mixtures. Application areas include the kinetic theory of dilute gas mixtures, and plasma dynamics. Please see my [Research Page](https://evanhabbershaw.github.io/research/) for more information.
